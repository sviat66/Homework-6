                <h2>Anse Source d'Argent</h2>
                <p>Anse Source d’Argent, in the south-west of La Digue, has often been described as the most beautiful beach in the world, and it is certainly one of the Seychelles’ most famous attractions. The beautiful mix of turquoise water, golden sand, and impressive boulders makes it a unique prospect worldwide. Access to Anse Source d’Argent is via the Union Estate, which charges 115 Rupees per person each day for access, however the outcome is well-worth the fee. Besides this initial entrance fee, access to the beach is easy thanks to a number of well-signposted paths. One of the main reasons for the beach’s popularity, besides its astounding beauty, is its variety of activities. The shallow, clear water, as well as the coral reef protection, means the beach is a great spot for families, and is also perfect for swimming and snorkelling. That said, it can be difficult to swim here at low tide, as the water is extremely shallow, but at high tide, the water is deep enough to swim while still being shallow enough to be safe for most swimmers. The protection provided to the beach by the coral reef ensures that the open ocean feels far away, so parents shouldn’t worry about their kids playing in the water. On top of that, the nearby restaurants and fruit stands mean you can easily spend a whole day here if you like, although those wanting the beach to themselves should arrive before 10.00. As mentioned, the beach is also famous for having been used in a number of prominent photoshoots and films, including movies such as Emanuelle, Crusoe, and Castaway, as well as the famous Bacardi adverts of the 1990s. Anse Source d’Argent is truly a must-see for all Seychelles holidaymakers, and especially for those staying on La Digue. The unique mixture of shallow water, pristine white sand, and impressive granite boulders make it a real treat, and one that visitors will remember for a long time.</p>

                <h2>Navagio Beach</h2>
                <p>Navagio Beach (aka Shipwreck Cove) on the Greek Island of Zakynthos is arguably one of the most beautiful beaches in the world! Here’s how to see shipwreck beach for yourself.The island of Zakynthos off the southwest coast of Greece is one of the country’s quieter islands. However it has one particularly incredible highlight called Navagio Beach (also known as Shipwreck Beach). A sandy little cove surrounded by towering limestone cliffs — plus the rusting remains of an old shipwreck.This stunning Greek beach surrounded by brilliant blue ocean water is an Instagram favorite, and many travelers include Zakynthos on their itinerary specifically to visit this amazing beach in Greece.We spent 3-days exploring Zakynthos with a rental car, including a few trips to Shipwreck Beach, and wanted to put together a little guide for you.The most popular postcard photos of Shipwreck Beach come from the top of the 200 meter (650 ft) tall cliffs that overlook it, rather than on the beach itself. While the beach is awesome to visit in person, the views from the cliffs are much more spectacular.However keep in mind that Navagio beach is located on another side of the island from the capital city of Zakynthos (same name as the island). So the best way to get out there is to either rent a car, like we did, or find a tour company that will take you out there in a van. It’s also possible to hire a taxi from the capital, but it will cost around €100 EURO round trip.The drive from Zakynthos town out to Navagio Beach takes about 45 minutes. Once there, you’ll head down an entrance road to the parking area, where there are a few stalls selling food, ice cream, drinks, and souvenirs. Parking is free.</p>

                <h2>Bora Bora</h2>
                <p>Dreaming of a tropical vacation on Bora Bora beaches? Imagine glimmering, turquoise, lagoon water...for as far as your peripheral vision can see. Surround it with white sandy beaches, fringed by a ring of vivid green, palm studded motus.When I first showed my Bora Bora photos to friends, everyone asked me if they had been 'photo-shopped.' The answer is 'No'. The water really is that color, only better, when you are there! The vivid shades of emerald, turquoise, azure and royal blue are mesmerizing! The beaches here are even more beautiful than pictures can convey. They are the reason I have become a Bora Bora Island addict.Ideal weather means Tahiti beaches offer pleasure all year. And some people actually move here. I was buying some pretty shell jewelery at a store in Bora Bora and chatted to the sales assistant. Her accent told me that she was an Australian. She came for a holiday, fell in love with the beaches (and a man)...and never went home. You can see why!The incredible pictures of these most photographed Tahiti beaches are what lures most of us to Bora Bora. And the brilliant beaches, wrapped around the sheltered circular lagoon will offer an ongoing invitation to linger, throughout your stay. The unique geography creates tranquil water with temperatures as tempting as the  colors. In winter the average is 79°F (26°C) and in summer it's an unbelievable 84°F (29°C). Make sure you know what to take to Bora Bora to make the most of your Bora Bora beach vacation.Some of the most picturesque stretches of sand are settings for luxurious Bora Bora Beach Resorts. Most of the Bora Bora beaches are privately owned, except for Matira Beach. When you take a lagoon tour your guide will include a visit to a private motu, and this gives you access to some very romantic, pristine beaches out on islets. Our favourite tour is with Marona of Lagoon Service tours. He took us to his own tiny motu home where we snorkeled from his beach and ate luscious freshly prepared island fruit.

                <h2>Whiteheaven</h2>
                <p>Whitehaven Beach is on Whitsunday Island, Australia. The island is accessible by boat, seaplane & helicopter from Airlie Beach, as well as Hamilton Island. It lies across from Stockyard Beach, better known as Chalkie's Beach, on Haslewood Island. The beach is known for its crystal white silica sands and turquoise coloured waters. The beach has tour barbeque and camping facilities. The beach was named and discovered in 1879 by Staff Commander EP Bedwell. 'Whitehaven' specifically originates from the English town of the same name, it was one of the many names, from the then English county of Cumberland, which Bedwell brought to the area. It followed James Cook's 1770 naming of the island group, the Cumberland Islands.[1] The beach was awarded Queensland's Cleanest Beach in Keep Australia Beautiful's 2008 Beach Challenge State Awards.[2] In July 2010, Whitehaven Beach was named the top Eco Friendly Beach in the world by CNN.com.[3] Dogs are not permitted on the beach and cigarette smoking is prohibited.[2]Whitehaven Beach is known for its bright white sands, which consist of 98% pure silica. Local rocks do not contain silica so it has been suggested that the sands were brought to the beach by prevailing sea currents over millions of years.[4]Unlike regular sand, the sand on Whitehaven Beach does not retain heat making it comfortable to walk barefoot on a hot day. This sand is also very fine, and can damage electronic equipment such as telephones and cameras, although it is good at polishing up jewellery.[5] Tourists and locals visit Whitehaven Beach to swim and take in the bright white sand. Some visitors eat a BBQ lunch,[6] and campers can stay by booking the National Parks camp facilities.[7The Whitehaven Beach Ocean Swim is a 2 km open swimming competition held on the beach in November each year since 2009 as part of the Hamilton Island Triathlon. The 2012 event was held on 11 November 2012.[8] The beach was also featured in the racing video game Forza Horizon 3.[9]In 2018, the government announced an investment of $3.9 million for the construction of a new long-distance walking track and upgrading of the camping areas on the Island to improve the holiday experience of the visitors. The track will connect Whitehaven Beach to the Tongue Point.[10]
